# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the presence of heart disease in patients using the **UCI Heart Disease Dataset**.

## 📌 Project Description

The goal of this project is to classify whether a patient has heart disease or not based on their medical attributes. It is formulated as a **binary classification problem**:

- **0**: No heart disease  
- **1**: Presence of heart disease
